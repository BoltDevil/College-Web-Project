    <p style="font-size:30px;font-weight: bold;margin: 10px;">Vision</p>
    <p id="font">Our vision is to create a school where learning is defined by the child’s inherent desire to learn,
        inspired by a philosophy of Love, Joy and Faith in the child as a learner, and guided by educational
        research and knowledge development.
        For us, this search is the beginning of a journey – of moving with the strengths of known educational
        principles to the evolution of new practices of learning, nurturing and sharing. We invite you to be a
        part of this journey through a variety of ways – by learning with us, by contributing in thought and
        spirit and by sharing your learning experiences.

        Each child is unique and has the ability to learn if supported by the right academic environment.
        The VIP School aims to provide quality education through a dynamic and diverse teaching environment
        to create the right platform for the leaders of tomorrow.

        The VIP School,Patna was founded in 1985 with the sole intention of providing
        quality learning to each and every student.Director sir Brij Ballabh Sharma Over the decades more
        than 5000 students have passed out from the institute with flying colors Today we are proud to say
        that the VIP School is counted among the leading schools in Patna.

        Our aim is to foster and nurture the children of our country to excel in all walks of life by gaining
        knowledge through continuous learning and building a strong character by respecting diversity of
        thoughts and culture. The combination of our innovative teaching style with traditional teaching
        provides the students an ideal launching platform to be well prepared for the future challenges.
        Every year the strength of the students who appear and pass the annual board examination is
        ascending rapidly. In the last academic year many of our hard working students have surpassed all
        the hurdles and got selected in National Talent Search Exam, National Science Talent Test and in
        other District level Examinations. I am also happy to share that many of our students have
        cleared the challenges of tough competitive examinations like IIT, PMT, PET, AIEEE, NDA ,CA
        and CS and have joined top degree education institutes of the country.

        I take this opportunity to pay my humble respect to all the well-wishers and scholars who have
        directly or indirectly helped and guided us in our endeavors. I also thank all our students and
        staffs whose combined hard work has made possible the excellent consistent performance in the
        annual board examinations. I believe that with all the support and efforts we can soon be counted
        as one of the top School.

        Every child is like a seed which has the potential to grow if it is nourished with love and
        care under the right 471113_10150666636275845_764232454_oguidance. In the current challenging times it
        is essential that children should not only excel in academics but should also develop courtesy,
        discipline, smart personality, social sensitivity and be imbibed with the traditional values and
        culture of our country. Childhood is the best time to lay the foundation of the core values essential
        for the overall development of the future citizen of tomorrow.

        VIP School is a friendly school where each and every student is understood, valued and
        attended too. Our students are provided with the state of the art facilities like well-equipped
        science laboratory, computer laboratory and audio visual room. Equal attention is given to the
        development of the children both academically and in extra curricular activities like different
        sports, yoga, cultural activities, etc.

        Year by year the efforts of all our staff and students have taken the school forward in terms of
        excellence. The school has progressed in leaps and bounds. Today we stand as one of the noted
        educational landmarks in the heart of Patna. We offer our students a stress free learning environment
        which encourages creativity and critical thinking.

        At VIP School we are dedicated to exhaustive quality learning and are utterly
        committed to a continuous process of improvement for the benefit of the students.

    <p id="font">
        At VIP School, our approach to learning is child centric, encouraging
        activity-based learning and inculcating a scientific temper and a spirit of free enquiry.
        Children these days are much more sensitive; they possess very high self-esteem and believe in
        independent thinking. Therefore, we ensure that the approach to motivating and getting the best
        out of the children is based on the positive reinforcement of good work and good behavior.
        Our educational philosophy is centered on praise, encouragement, enthusiasm, and affection,
        rather than criticism, fear, and punishment.

        The school is also devoted to prepare our students for life, groom them to face the challenges of
        tomorrow, and encourage them to be socially relevant. We encourage each child to develop in their
        special field of interest so as to best showcase their particular type of talent. We constantly
        endeavor to always live up to this ideology and inculcate this into everything we do, with the aim
        that we will be able to ensure that the children grow to their full potential, while constantly
        being groomed to pass out as men and women competent to bear responsibility in all walks of life.
        We hone the academic skills, fine-tune the aesthetic senses and work towards building a Holistic
        culture that values the individuality of each pupil, helping them realize their innate potential. Children are
        encouraged to explore and revel in the joy of learning. Rote learning is discouraged and Research Based learning
        is the norm, where each pupil is guided through an individualized work plan in consonance with his/her
        potential, thereby providing a complete learning experience.

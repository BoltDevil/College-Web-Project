            A school is actually a home away from home for any student.

            learning anything and everything in various dimensions from books, teachers, peers
            and even school environs

                    Mental and physical development is quite necessary for the wholesome development of a personality.
                    Having this in mind our school authorities have chosen a playground ideal in many respects.

                    Our playground has a number of big trees under which we sit and talk on matters of interest to us.
                    There is a small river by the side of the playground. But the students are warned not to swim in the
                    river.
                    The students who want to become swimmers are given training by some expert swimmers among the
                    students.
                    In the evening there is a pleasant breeze in the playground.

        <li>A classroom or schoolroom is a learning space in which both children and adults learn.
            Classrooms are found in educational institutions of all kinds, ranging from preschools to universities,
            and may also be found in other places where education or training is provided,
            such as corporations and religious and humanitarian organizations.
            The classroom provides a space where learning can take place uninterrupted by outside distractions.

            Instead of having desks, this classroom has a combination of tables and computer stations.
            There are five rows of tables near the front of the classroom.
            Each row contain two tables and each table sits to students.
            There are also two larger table behind these rows that can set four people each, two on each side.
            In the front of the room, centered between to two sets of tables, in a central smart board.
            The computer station are positioned around the sides and back of the room.
            Each station contains one computer and is separated from the station next to it by divider walls.
            This is a much bigger room then the first classroom.
            It also contains less posters and I noticed that there is no clock in the room.
